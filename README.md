SimplerHidWrite
===============

A modern version of the [SimpleHidWrite](http://janaxelson.com/hidpage.htm)
utility written in C#/WinForms.

This utility includes a few improvements over SimpleHidWrite. The overall
user experience has improved through small changes like correct tab ordering,
automatically clearing a byte textbox's contents on selection, and displaying
more details in the device selection list.

SimplerHidWrite also has compatibility with a wider range of devices with
varying degrees of validity. More errors are handled and caught, preventing
the program from locking up or crashing.
